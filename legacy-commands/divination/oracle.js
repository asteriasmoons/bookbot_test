      "Reject stagnancy; to get unstuck, take action. The choice to grow should  be made.",
      "Something precious is all about you, but it has become so familiar you can barely see it anymore. It is such a fixture in your life that familiarity has bred, if not contempt, a kind of blindness.",
      "Stop! Stop right now! Your intuition-your inner sight and clear vision, is sending you a very clear warning. A red flag has just gone up and this is the time to stop, to look, and listen before going forward.",

      "Part of you that is natural and beautiful, most likely your body and appearance, has been influenced by thoughts and ideas about it being unworthy, unhealthy and perhaps even dirty! It is time to clean up your act! Not of your natural looks but the way you have thought about yourself.",

Mourning for what was and what should have been. Very deep sadness and yet this experience has been of great value. It is time to move on and to place all of that to rest.",
